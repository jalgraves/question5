# Massachusetts Voters Please Vote NO on Question 5

This is going to change your dining and drinking experience for the worse. 

An out of state radical activist group without the first clue about restaurant economics is attempting upend the lives of business owners and their employees in the MA service industry.

## Background

in order to grasp what's happening it's important to understand a little about the minimum wage and how tipped workers earn their wages.

The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) established the minimum wage in 1938, in 1966 provisions were added for a tipped minimum wage creating the dual wage system that is in place today. Federally the regular minimum wage is $7.25 an hour and the tipped minimum wage is $2.13 an hour. Individual states are allowed to set their own minimum wages and many do, including the Bay State. The Massachusetts regular minimum wage is $15.00 an hour and the tipped minimum wage is $6.75. In all states the difference between the two hourly wages is what constitutes the tip credit.

The tip credit allows employers to pay tipped employees (any employee that makes at least $30 a month in tips) the tipped minimum wage provided that the hourly wage plus the tips earned in a given pay period amount to the regular minimum wage. If your tips plus your hourly don’t equal the regular minimum wage then employers must pay the difference. Everything after the minimum wage is paid goes into the tip pool.

As a simple example if I work 8 hours bartending and earn $100.00 in tips that comes out to $154.00 (8 hours X 6.75 + 100), the minimum wage for that shift would be $120.00 (8 hours X 15.00). My employer would owe me no further pay and $34.00 would be distributed to me in my next paycheck. However if I only made $50.00 in tips my employer would have to pay the $16.00 difference from the regular minimum wage.

Question 5 aims to eliminate the state's tip credit and have employers bare the full burden of paying tipped employees the regular minimum wage. The initiative also has implications for how employees’s tips are distributed. If enacted, the new law would green light restaurant tip pools – which could require tips be shared with non-tipped, non-customer-facing staff who are not paid a tipped wage but rather subject to salary or the hourly minimum wage.

On the face of it you might be thinking "This doesn't sound so bad we're giving more money to hard working people, what kind of cruel person could oppose this?".

The tipped workers of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, that's who. That's right the very workers that this law claims to protect are overwhelmingly opposed to it. A survey of 351 tipped employees currently working at full-service restaurants in Massachusetts was conducted in February 2024. Here are the key findings:

1. 86% think the current tipping system works for them.
2. 90% believe that if tipped wages are eliminated, tipped employees will earn less.
3. 88% oppose a mandatory tip pool where tips are shared with the kitchen and other non-service
staff. 
4. 91% say they prefer the current system, with a lower base wage and tips that provide the ability
to earn more than the minimum wage.
5. 56% of respondents report earning more than $30.00/per hour.

It's not just servers in the Bay State that feel this way. The Ohio Restaurant & Hospitality Alliance conducted an online survey of nearly 1,000 tipped workers and found that 93% want to keep the current tipped system, 83% report that they make more than $20 an hour and 85% think customers won't continue tipping at the same level if they also have to pay a service charge on their bills.

This is not some grand experiment, seven states and Washington D.C have already eliminated their tips credits. The data that comes bach shows that the service industry is worse off than it was with the tip credit.

In 2016 Maine eliminated their tip credit. Chaos ensued, as servers and bartenders would attest to at public hearings in April (six months after it passed, and three and half months after it went into effect). Servers got paid full hourly rates, so menu prices went up (because restaurants only have one income stream, it’s not like they could raise sponsorships or get a grant to offset the payroll expense increase), so people came in less. Servers testified that customers also began saying, “Oh, you don’t have to tip now, that’s what we voted on.”
